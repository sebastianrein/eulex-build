        <p class="Normal">
            <span>The TEN-E Regulation, adopted in 2013, has contributed to the Union’s core energy policy</span><span> </span><span>objectives</span><span> by laying down rules for identifying and ensuring the timely development of Projects of Common Interest (PCIs), that will ensure interoperability of trans-European energy networks, the functioning of the internal energy market, security of supply in the Union and the integration of renewable forms of energy. It has also contributed to streamlined permit granting procedures for Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) and provided for regulatory assistance, rules and guidance for the cross-border allocation of costs and risk-related incentives and the conditions to access financing from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The TEN-E Regulation was revised in 2022 to bring the framework in line with the 2050 climate neutrality objective under the European Green Deal. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>While the objectives of the TEN-E Regulation remain largely valid, several short-comings need to be addressed to ensure the framework</span><span> is fit to support a decarbonised, competitive and resilient energy system towards 2050, in line with the Clean Industrial Deal objectives and the European Climate Law. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>First, e</span><span>xisting and planned infrastructure projects are not sufficiently targeted towards achieving the EU’s energy and climate objectives</span><span>. There is a substantial gap between our cross-border electricity infrastructure needs and </span><span>the</span><span> speed and level of infrastructure development at both the transmission and distribution grid level.</span><span
                class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" href="#footnote13" id="footnoteref13">12</a>
               </span><span> </span><span>For electricity, about half of cross-border electricity needs for 2030 (41 of 88 GW) will remain unaddressed, and this gap is expected to increase the next decade. By 2040, cross-border electricity capacity needs will amount to 108 GW.</span><span
                class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" href="#footnote14" id="footnoteref14">13</a>
               </span><span> Failing to address infrastructure needs could hinder system decarbonisation, undermine security of supply and potentially lead to further market fragmentation and higher energy prices. </span><span>From system efficiency perspective, current framework does not consider </span><span>use of alternatives to grid expansion, such as non-wire or digital solutions.</span><span> Further, improved hydrogen network planning and integration will be crucial to ensure system optimisation and decarbonisation of industry. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Second, the implementation of cross-border infrastructure projects is too slow</span><span>, increasing overall project costs and impeding network development. The completion of electricity infrastructure projects takes up to 10 years for transmission grids. Delays are often attributed to difficulties in reaching agreement on </span><span>cost-sharing </span><span>when projects carry benefits outside their hosting Member States. As cross-border infrastructure becomes more integrated, the number of such projects with benefits occurring outs</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>ide the hosting Member States is expected to increase. In addition, delayed </span><span>permitting procedures </span><span>continue to constitute a key bottleneck, accounting for more than half of the time needed to complete an electricity transmission infrastructure project. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Finally, concerns over infrastructure security</span><span>. Recent physical and cyber security incidents have highlighted the risk of hostile actors targeting the Union’s energy infrastructure, with economic cost implications and consequences for the stability of our energy system. There is also a rising interest from third-country actors to invest in EU energy infrastructure, which can increase the Union’s exposure to risks related to energy security. Beyond deliberate acts of sabotage, emerging risks including natural hazards and climate-related impacts also affect the resilience of the EU’s energy infrastructure.</span>

        <p class="Normal">
            <span>This proposal to revise the TEN-E Regulation aims to address these issues, which were identified in the Impact Assessment and Implementation Report accompanying this proposal. Specifically, the proposal will introduce changes to: </span>

            <span>Energy transmission infrastructure (including an interconnected offshore grid and smart grid infrastructure) has a European added value due to its cross-border impacts and is essential to achieve a climate neutral energy system. The TEN-E Regulation has contributed to achieving results regarding the Union energy market integration, competition and security of supply. A framework for regional cooperation across Member States is necessary to develop cross-border energy infrastructure. The internal energy market requires cross-border infrastructure, the development of which requires cooperation of two or more Member States, all with their own regulatory framework. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>National regulation and planning are not sufficient as individual national administrations do not have the power to deal with cross-border infrastructure planning. Internal network elements significantly influence the possibilities of cross-border infrastructure development, which in turn affects cross-border trade. More closely coordinating national and European planning is necessary due to the character of the EU’s meshed network and to build a more efficient energy system.</span>

        <p class="Normal">
            <span>The TEN-E Regulation has provided added value compared to what could have been achieved at national or regional level alone. More than 100 projects were completed thanks to the PCI status between 2013-2025. The accelerated electrification, decarbonisation and digitalisation of industry and deployment of renewable energy projects call for the reinforcement of energy infrastructure at an unprecedented pace, that cannot be met by national measures alone. More effective cross-border planning will improve the integration of clean energy sources as well as meeting electricity market needs, which would help the EU reach its energy and climate targets. A more integrated market encourages the development and uptake of innovative technologies for transmission and distribution of energy and contributes to system flexibility and security of supply. This can result in a more efficient network and improve cross-border trade for a more cost-efficient and secure energy system.</span>

            <span>The Implementation Report provided evidence of the need for further improvements, namely when it comes to scenario development, infrastructure needs identification and consequent Ten Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP), PCI/PMI project selection and assessment, as well as cross-border cost allocation (CBCA) and permitting frameworks. The report found that the scenario development and infrastructure gaps identification processes are faced with drawbacks, including delays which hamper their effectiveness in meeting the TEN-E Regulation goals. The Commission and ACER have little means to steer the process towards identification of the key projects for the Union. Moreover, while the permitting-related amendments of the 2022 revision of TEN-E Regulation generally achieved their intended objective to increase the clarity and flexibility of procedures, further improvements could be made to support the acceleration of procedures, contributing to the process’s overall efficiency. Regarding cross-border cost allocation, the TEN-E Regulation provisions have facilitated the allocation of investment costs for PCI/PMIs, primarily to support CEF applications. However, there have been very few instances of involvement of non-hosting countries in CBCA decisions, and none in the electricity sector. Provisions have therefore had limited effectiveness in triggering additional investments from non-hosting countries that may otherwise significantly benefit from the projects.</span>

            <span>In line with the Better Regulation guidelines, the Commission carried out a comprehensive online public consultation between 13 May to 5 August 2025 on the ‘Have Your Say’ website. The consultation covered the following topics: i) the general functioning of the TEN-E Regulation, ii) EU infrastructure planning, iii) electricity network planning at national level, iv) electricity grid hosting capacity, v) permitting, vi) investments in grid infrastructure, vii) supply chains, viii) digitalisation and resilience, and ix) simplification. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>The consultation received a total of 197 responses. In addition, 2 emails were received via a functional mailbox for the consultation. There were 197 responses to every multiple-choice question in the public consultation, meaning that every respondent answered each question. For some questions, respondents were asked on a five-point scale the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with statements. The scale was i) Strongly disagree ii) Slightly disagree, iii) Neutral, iv) Slightly agree, v) Strongly agree. A “don’t know” option was also given.  </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Stakeholders’ views were split on whether the TYNDP and national transmission development plans ensure integrated and coherent planning across EU and national levels. Opinions on the extent to which the TYNDP identifies all cross-border infrastructure needs were also diverse. Still, a majority (54%) indicated that the current governance framework of the TYNDPs, including stakeholder roles, should be revised to enhance its effectiveness. Moreover, in line with the legislative proposal, about half (44%) believed the TYNDP falls short in addressing identified infrastructure gaps and a majority (60%) agreed that national projects should more clearly support EU-wide priorities. Further, a majority of respondents (61%) also agreed that there is a need for stronger alignment between national transmission development plans. In addition, a majority of respondents (59%) were positive to streamlining the PCI/PMI application process by amending requirements for projects with PCI/PMI status to reapply during each process (provided certain conditions are met) in line with this proposal.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>When asked whether the TYNDP should have a more top-down approach to infrastructure planning aimed at aligning network development with EU and Member State climate and energy goals, 41% of respondents (many of which system operators) disagreed whereas 36% agreed. Similarly, 41% of respondents (many of which system operators) expressed disagreement with the TYNDP having a more top-down European approach to better link identified needs and priority projects of common European interest, whereas 36% agreed. While this legislative proposal strengthens EU-level steer in the infrastructure planning process with the Commission taking over central scenario development and being empowered to launch calls for proposal to address infrastructure gaps, the proposal maintains strong Member State involvement and validation of steps in the process striking a balance to also align with the public consultation results. On the frequency of the processes, most stakeholders (85%) found the current two-year cycle appropriate. The legislative proposal prolongs the current two-year TYNDP cycle to four years, but maintains flexibility if updates are needed. </span>

The measures under each intervention area were grouped into three policy options, following a logic of varying degrees of EU-level intervention and coordination, and taking into account internal compatibility and coherence of the measures (see Section 5.2.2 of the Impact Assessment Report).</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Policy option 1</span><span> entails </span><span>an enhanced bottom-up approach</span><span>, introducing only a limited number of changes to the current EU legislative and policy framework in comparison to the business as usual and involves minimal additional EU-level intervention. As regards </span><span>infrastructure planning and project implementation</span><span>, </span><span>it strengthens the existing framework by better defining certain requirements and simplifying processes (including PCI/PMI selection and Commission and ACER approvals) to ensure a leaner and more robust planning process. It also aligns the scope of PCI/PMI project categories, including by strengthening requirements related to electrolysers and removing the smart gas grid category. As regards </span><span>cost and benefit sharing</span><span>, </span><span>it enhances transparency and strengthens EU principles as well as better enables the use of congestion income for financing cross-border electricity infrastructure as an incentive to cost-sharing. On </span><span>permitting,</span><span> </span><span>it supports implementation of existing legislation, including by issuing guidance on the implementation of certain aspects of the environmental assessment framework.

As regards </span><span>cost-benefit sharing</span><span>, it</span><span> </span><span>introduces an enabling framework for the voluntary bundling of cross-border projects to enable and encourage discussions amongst relevant Member States and third countries. On </span><span>permitting</span><span>, </span><span>it entails targeted legislative changes to accelerate permitting processes for cross-border infrastructure covered under the TEN-E Regulation. On </span><span>security,</span><span> </span><span>it introduces additional transparency requirements regarding the ultimate beneficial owners of candidate PCIs/PMIs and including security and resilience-related equipment for the upgrade of existing electricity cross-border infrastructure under TEN-E scope. </span>

            <span>The policy options were compared along their </span><span>effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and proportionality</span><span>. Policy option 2 and 3 are considered more effective, efficient and coherent with the overall EU policy framework than policy option 1. Policy option 1 only performs slightly better in terms of subsidiarity and proportionality. Therefore, policy option 1 is not considered as possible preferred policy option. While policy options 2 and 3 both perform better than policy option 1 as concerns their effectiveness in meeting the specific objectives, policy option 2 seems overall more effective at this stage when it comes to ensuring that projects included in network plans and selected as PCI/PMIs address appropriately identified infrastructure needs as well as to shorten and simplify permitting procedures. As regards the efficiency, policy option 3 is considered less efficient due to the additional resources needed and high-up front costs to set up two new entities at EU level (or reinforce existing ones) responsible for infrastructure planning and coordinated permitting procedures. In terms of subsidiarity and proportionality, measures proposed in policy option 3 (i.e. EU entities responsible for infrastructure planning and permitting as well as mandatory offshore grid planning) with a high degree of EU level intervention appear disproportionate at this stage considering they do not result in a higher level of effectiveness and are expected to entail substantially higher additional costs.</span>

            <span>As regards economic impacts, it is expected to significantly reduce energy system costs in line with the optimal grid scenario by ensuring that identified projects better match and fully cover the identified needs. For 2040, investments of EUR 6 bn/year into the optimal grid would lead to EUR 14 bn/year reduction in system costs, that is EUR 8 bn/year net saving.

            <span>The revised TEN-E Regulation is expected to bring positive impacts in terms of simplification and improved efficiency. The initiative is expected to reduce the administrative burden on ENTSOs, TSOs and project promoters notably as regards infrastructure planning as a result of the Commission taking over central scenario development and through simplifications such as the reduced frequency to a four-year cycle and the amended application and evaluation process for mature PCIs. The streamlined, simplified and digitalised permitting procedures for PCIs and PMIs would also reduce the administrative burden for businesses.

        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter I of the Regulation outlines the general provisions, notably its subject matter, objectives and scope as well as the definitions applicable. It introduces, complemented by Annex II, new infrastructure categories compared to Regulation (EU) 2022/869 to ensure strengthened safety, security and efficiency of existing networks, notably to enable existing high-voltage networks elements to operate systems safely through investments in monitoring control and digitalisation equipment and installations and to increase the protection and resilience of critical network elements through investment in equipment that is specifically designed for that purpose and physically connected to those elements. Project categories and definitions are also adjusted to align with the </span><span>EU’s decarbonised gas and hydrogen legislative package adopted in 2024 </span><span>setting common rules for the transition to renewable and low-carbon gases; this package prioritises the production and use of hydrogen in its pure form and its transportation in the dedicated hydrogen system. A definition of “non-wire” solutions in electricity is also introduced; these solutions need to be carefully considered as they may be cheaper than grid expansion to ensure cost-optimal grid planning. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter II outlines the provisions as regards the process of preparing the Union lists of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest within the regional groups, the criteria for the assessment of projects by the groups and the monitoring of project implementation. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 3, complemented by Annex III, provides rules for the establishment of regional groups as well as for the process for establishing the Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest. Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869, Article 3 and Annex III provide for a simplified approach for advanced projects already on the Union list to maintain their status of project of common interest or project of mutual interest. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869, Article 4 which sets out the criteria for the assessment of projects by the groups, complemented by Annex IV, further clarifies that projects of mutual interest extend to the first connection point in the third country and ensures that these projects are accompanied by corresponding development in internal infrastructure in third countries. For Energy Community contracting countries, the benefits brought by individual projects are considered for both EU and Energy Community contracting countries, and not only for the EU as done so far. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>In Article 5 the provisions on the implementation and monitoring of projects on the Union list are strengthened by requirements related to risk assessments as regards physical and cyber security, building on Directive (EU) 2022/2557 on the resilience of critical entities and Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union. As regards European coordinators that may be designated where a project encounters significant implementation difficulties, Article 6 provides that the period for which the designation applies may be renewed. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter III addresses the permit granting and public acceptance of projects of common interest. Compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/869  this chapter has been revised with three main objectives: (1) update the permitting framework to ensure that projects of common interest  and projects of mutual interest are granted the best treatment possible in line with their strategic importance and special status, especially when considering the permitting measures introduced in the Hydrogen and Decarbonised Gas Market Package and the revised Renewable Energy Directive; (2) update the permitting regime to support the accelerated permitting for electricity grids, in line with the needs recognised in the Draghi report and the amendments introduced in Directive (EU) 2019/944; (3) increase the clarity of the permitting regime and improve its efficiency. </span>

            <span>Article 7 on the priority status of projects on the Union list is updated to include requirements that electricity projects of common and mutual interest benefit from an automatic presumption of overriding public interest and, when included in a National Development Plan subjected to a strategical environmental assessment and to an appropriate assessment under Directive 92/43/EEC in case there is a likely significant impact on Natura 2000 sites, may, subject to strict conditions, be exempted from assessments under specified environmental legislation. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 8 on the organisation of the permit granting process clarifies the responsibilities of national competent authorities established under the Regulation in line with the different permitting schemes, especially in what concerns cooperation with other authorities and mediation of contacts with project promoters. It also increases the cross-border cooperation requirements for projects involving multiple jurisdictions. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 9 on transparency and public participation provides for increased clarity and simplicity of the procedure, notably by merging the reporting obligations of this article into a single report.</span>

        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 10 on duration and implementation of the permit granting process introduces in particular an obligation to digitalise permitting procedures; clarifies what is considered as the starting date for the permitting procedure; makes the optional nature of the pre-application phase clearer; elaborates on the steps comprising it (scoping, screening, scheduling, application file verification); clarifies the need to take into account existing studies and authorisations to reduce duplication when defining the documentation necessary for the permitting process; and introduces tacit approval to decisions taken by the concerned national authorities with the exception of environmental decisions. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter IV outlines the provisions as regards cross-sectoral infrastructure planning, which are strengthened compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/689, with a view to better steering of the planning, notably as regards the definition of future scenarios, the identification of long-term energy infrastructure needs and bottlenecks and addressing those needs with the most adequate solutions. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 11 empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts establishing a central scenario for the electricity, hydrogen and gas sectors to be used for the Union-wide TYNDP, the infrastructure needs identification process, the energy system wide cost-benefit analysis and the cross-border cost allocation of energy infrastructure projects. To ensure data used for developing the scenario are up-to date, the Commission has a right to request them from Member States, the ENTSO for Electricity, the </span><span>ENTSO for Gas</span><span>and the ENNOH, as relevant. The scenario should be developed in a cross-sectoral manner. TYNDP scenarios have until now been developed by the ENTSO for Electricity, the ENTSO for Gas and the ENNOH. </span>

        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 12 entrusts the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH, with developing an infrastructure needs identification report </span><span>for electricity and hydrogen respectively. The report should</span><span> identify infrastructure gaps affecting the Union’s objectives related to electricity and hydrogen, based in particular on a binding methodology to be prepared by ACER and the central scenario pursuant to Article 11. The Article provides that the infrastructure needs identification reports must be endorsed by the decision-making body of the TEN-E Group, which is the cross-regional meeting configuration of all Groups established under the Regulation. Specifically for electricity, the report must consider non-wire solutions when assessing and addressing the needs. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 13 empowers the Commission to launch a needs matching process in the electricity system to identify possible solutions for unmatched needs in case the infrastructure needs identification report for electricity concludes that projects submitted for inclusion in the Union wide ten-year network development plan do not fully meet the infrastructure needs identified pursuant to Article 12. The needs matching process should be based on existing regional cooperation, steered by the Commission and linked with the TYNDP process.  </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Article 14 mandates the ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH to use consistent single sector methodologies for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level when assessing projects (in all energy infrastructure categories except smart electricity grids and CO</span><span>2</span><span>) for their inclusion in their respective Union wide ten-year network development plans. The methodologies must be submitted to the Commission for approval. ENTSO for Electricity and the ENNOH are required to calculate and publish, as part of the Union-wide ten-year network development plan, the results of cost-benefit analyses for all projects, showing how the benefits are distributed across countries. The Article further specifies that for smart electricity grids projects and CO</span><span>2</span><span> projects, it is for the Commission to develop methodologies for a harmonised energy system-wide cost-benefit analysis at Union level, as is the case today. </span>

        <p class="Normal">
            <span>The provisions under Chapter V address the need to develop the grid to accommodate the significant expected scale-up of electricity generation from offshore renewable energy sources. The Chapter supports the coordinated long-term planning and development of offshore and onshore infrastructure. As a novelty, under Article 15  Member States are required, as part of their non-binding agreements and within their specific priority offshore grid corridors, to consider establishing specific cross-border goals, such as for hybrid or cross-border radial projects, with the aim to achieve the goals for offshore renewable generation to be deployed within each sea basin in the most efficient manner. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter VI strengthens the provisions for a regulatory framework enabling investments with a cross-border impact. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Firstly, it specifies in Article 17 the principles that national regulatory authorities must apply when allocating costs across borders, including that in order to ensure investment certainty, the cross-border cost allocation (‘CBCA’) must be based on an ex-ante cost-allocation agreement, with the possibility of ex-post adjustments, provided that such adjustments are explicitly defined in the cost allocation decision and clearly framed, including as regards timeframes and categories of costs covered. Where appropriate, the allocation of costs amongst Member States shall be based on the distribution of net-benefits. It also includes that if 10% or more of a project’s estimated benefits occur in a Member State, that Member State and its national regulatory authority shall take part in the cross-border cost allocation process. ACER is mandated to update its Recommendation on identifying good practices for the treatment of investment requests for projects in line with the above-mentioned principles and to establish a central repository of all cross-border cost-allocation decisions taken by national regulatory authorities and to host it on its website as well as to provide a non-binding CBCA template to facilitate the work of national regulatory agencies. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Secondly, a new Article (Article 18) is introduced, which supports a process under which  project promoters may bundle two or more projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  to facilitate the discussions on cost-sharing between the relevant Member States, and with third countries as appropriate, and the CBCA decisions between the concerned competent authorities of the Member States or between the competent authorities of the Member States and third countries, as appropriate. Article 18 further clarifies the rules on joint cost-benefit analysis and CBCA applicable to such bundles of projects in view of facilitating a possible CEF application. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Thirdly, new Article (Article 19) is introduced, requiring transmission system operators (‘TSOs’) to set aside, for network investments into projects on the Union list relevant to reducing interconnector congestion, 25% of the congestion rents not spent for guaranteeing the actual availability of allocated capacity and for compensation to offshore renewable electricity generation plant operators.  Article 19 specifies conditions for the use of the funds and empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further specify the conditions under which TSOs may use these funds and the conditions for their release. ACER is required to update its existing methodology on the use of revenues from congestion income pursuant Article 19(4) Electricity Regulation to ensure consistency with these new provisions.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Lastly, Article 20 lays down the conditions under which Member States and national regulatory authorities may grant appropriate incentives for projects that incur higher risks for the development, construction, operation or maintenance, when compared to the risks normally incurred by a comparable infrastructure project.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter VII sets out the conditions for the eligibility of projects on the Union list for financial assistance under the Connecting Europe Facility, including for the new infrastructure categories. In particular, compared with Regulation (EU) 2022/689, Article 21 sets out in more detail the criteria applicable for projects other than the energy infrastructure that are under the competence of national regulatory authorities. Since those projects do not receive a CBCA, they must receive an evaluation carried out by the relevant national authority and the provision develops the conditions for such an evaluation. Article 22 provides that the specific criteria set out in Article 4(3) and the parameters set out in Article 4(5) of the Regulation must be applied for the purpose of establishing award criteria for Union financial assistance under the Regulation on the Connecting Europe Facility and lays down additional requirements for legacy gas projects concerning Cyprus and Malta under Article 27 of the Regulation. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="Normal">
            <span>Chapter VIII includes final provisions regarding delegated acts, reporting and evaluation, including regarding the digitalisation of the permitting process, the improvement of physical and cyber security resilience of cross-border energy infrastructure and the uptake of non-wire solutions, the review of the Regulation as well as information and publicity of the projects. It further maintains the existing derogations for the gas interconnectors of Malta and Cyprus until Cyprus or Malta, respectively, is directly interconnected to the trans-European gas network or until 31 December 2029, whichever is the earlier. The Chapter further lists amendments to other energy acquis resulting from the amendments introduced in the Regulation and sets out transitional provisions and provisions for the repeal of the current TEN-E Regulation. In particular, the revised Regulation does not affect the granting, continuation or modification of financial assistance awarded previously under the Connecting Europe Facility, and the existing Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest  is to remain in force and produce effects until a new Union list of projects of common interest and projects of mutual interest pursuant to this Regulation is established and enters into force. </span>

            <span class="num"><span class="CommentReference">(69)</span></span><span>The internal energy market legislation requires that tariffs for access to networks provide appropriate incentives for investment. However, several types of projects of common interest are likely to have externalities that might not be fully captured in, and recovered through, the regular tariff system. In applying the internal energy market legislation, national regulatory authorities should ensure a stable and predictable regulatory and financial framework with incentives for projects of common interest, including long-term incentives, that are commensurate with the level of specific risk of the project. That framework should apply in particular to cross-border projects, innovative transmission technologies for electricity allowing for the large scale integration of renewable energy, of distributed energy resources or of demand response in interconnected networks, and energy technology and digitalisation projects, which are either likely to incur higher risks than similar projects located within one Member State or which promise higher benefits for the Union. Moreover, projects with high operational expenditure should also have access to appropriate incentives for investment. In particular, offshore grids for renewable energy, which serve the dual functionality of electricity interconnectors and connecting renewable offshore generation projects, are likely to incur higher risks than comparable onshore infrastructure projects, due to their intrinsic connection to generation assets which brings regulatory risks, financing risks such as the need for anticipatory investments, market risks and risks pertaining to the use of new innovative technologies.</span><span

PCIs have also strongly contributed to security of supply as a main contextual driver to the design of the TEN-E Regulation.

The updated plan includes three new actions: an awareness-raising campaign focusing on Commission ethics issues and anti-fraud measures, with relevant examples tailored for JRC scientific staff, launched in the first half of 2025; an expanded training programme featuring thematic sessions on topics such as conflict of interest, authorship, the use of AI, whistleblowing and reporting channels, among others; updated Sharepoint pages dedicated to ethics issues and anti-fraud measures. These new actions complement the ongoing efforts from the 2021-2024 Action Plan and JRC participation in the Commission Antifraud Strategy Action Plan.

                        <span>Requirement 1 (R1) relates to scenario development processes and infrastructure needs identification, which should consider the potential use of digital and smart solutions next to physical grid development already in the modelling part of the network development planning. As a related requirement, transmission system operators in electricity are required to consider with priority non-wire and digital solutions when proposing new infrastructure projects, with such requirements applicable on a European level (as part of the EU-wide ten-years network development plan) as well as on a national level (national network development plans on a transmission level). This will help ensuring  maximum efficiency in grid development and also incentivise use of digital solutions in practice.</span>

                        <span>Requirement 2 (R2) relates to introduction of a new non-wire and digital transmission category for Projects of Common Interest. Such category aims to provide better incentives for use of grid enhancing and digital technologies by transmission system operators, to increase efficiency of grid utilisation and increase cross-border transmission capacity. When applying for the new category, transmission system operators are required to submit data related to technical characteristics of proposed digitalisation systems as well as expected impacts on the transmission system operation. ENTSO for Electricity, as a body proposed for calculating the costs and benefits of new projects, would be responsible for processing related data.</span>

While assumptions on potential of such technologies exist in literature, Member States’ data are currently not publicly available and are not collected for the same purpose (once-only principle has been duly followed). Transmission system operators will start assessing flexibility needs assessment pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/943 as of 2026 and some of the data being used can also be used for purposes of grid planning. However, the span of the former is only 10 years, while Union-wide grid planning covers upcoming 10-20 years. In this regard, data collection seems inevitable to ensure full coverage. Secondary legislation on concrete format of data will ensure existing collections for the purposes of Flexibility Needs Assessments are taken into account to avoid any duplication in requirements. Regarding the data flow, data are provided by transmission system operators, regulatory authorities and Member States to the Commission based on rule to be adopted via secondary legal acts. Additional data for grid modelling, if necessary, are to be provided by transmission system operators directly to the ENTSO for electricity.</span>

It also does not have an effect on cross-border inter-operability as the data is of relevance for national, rather than EU-level decision-making procedures. A centrally defined data structure has been considered and discarded, since due to the mostly national character of the biggest percentage of the permitting procedures in each MS and the different permitting systems, it is logical that the actual decision on format for the implementation is left to MS, which can decide what fits best to their system and the new digital platform they will set up. While TEN-E Regulation requires national competent authorities in charge of permitting to cooperate in cross border projects to the extent possible, it gives Member States the freedom to decide on the most appropriate way to do so. Since part of the data in question may also be required and assessed for procedures related with projects not covered unde TEN-E regulation, it will also be proposed that these platforms are set up as multi-purpose platform that covers the permitting of a wide range of energy asets (grids,pipelines, renewables, storage, etc).</span>
